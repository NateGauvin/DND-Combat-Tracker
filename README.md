This project requires the JDK 21 Development Kit.
This project can be run by placing the InitiativeAndCharacterTracker.jar in a folder with the Charcters folder.
You can then create a txt file called "Run.txt" (you also need to have file extensions turned on).
Type "java -jar InitiativeAndCharacterTracker.jar" in Run.txt, and save it.
Then change the file extension to ".bat" and run the file.

This tracker allows you to create character files and bring them into the program to run in D&D combat encounter.
You can keep track of initiative, hit points, armor class, and stats.
The tracker starts off with two modes, negative damage or flat damage. One brings HP past zero, and the other only brings HP down to zero.
While all other stats are self-explanatory for D&D, External Initiative Bonus refers to any bonuses to initiative granted through Alert and other feats.
This tracker is not limited to player characters, and can be used for enemies and NPCs all the same.

To delete characters, simply delete their respective character's .txt file.
